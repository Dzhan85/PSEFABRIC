Psefabric model.

We have these layers in our model of psefabric:
1. Configuration Management Engine
2. Configuration Analyser
3. Demultiplexer
4. Configurator
5. MOs Configuration Loader
6. Control Plans of MOs
7. Data Plans of MOs

Main principles of data flow.

1. The data always flow in the direction from the higher layer to the lower one.
2. Exchange always occurs only either within the layer (between different part of the layer) or between adjacent layers.
3. The psefabric.py script is the dataflow manager. It runs scripts in the correct order and is responsible for exchanging data between them.

Debugging.

There is a powful debuging mechanism in psefabric. You may examine almost any essential internal data exhange.
If debugging is on (PSEFABRIC/PSEF_SCRIPTS/psef_debug.py) this information is saved in the folder PSEFABRIC/PSEF_LOGS/.
For comfort of reading they will be saved in json format.
