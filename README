PSEFABRIC is a new approach to network automation and management.

It provides a single point of network management with a simple and intuitive interface, and on the other hand, 
this solution is very flexible and can work with a wide range of network architectures, with different types 
of equipment and vendors.

This allows you to see the entire network as a whole and manage it as a single device and at the same time this 
approach preserves all the strengths of your network. 

You may use different vendors, architectures, equipment (including firewalls and load balancers), etc. In general, 
you don't need to change your old network.

Two important examples are given here:
- project p001 shows how this approach can be implemented for Cisco Routers/Switches, 
  Cisco ASA and Juniper FWs centralized management 
- project p002 is a PSEFABRIC solution for underlying networks based on the Cisco ACI/Palo Alto FWs solutions.

PSEFABRIC implementation does not require the purchase of any new equipment or software. 

This implementation of PSEFABRIC is designed to manage subnets, accesses, service chains and can be useful for 
data-centers and offices. This approach may also be used for VMs and load balancing VSes creation/deleting. 

But PSEFABRIC is something more than this specific implementation. This is an approach, a new concept. 
And in the framework of this approach, if it is possible to automate something in your network, you can 
build it into a PSEFABRIC.

I hope you will enjoy.
