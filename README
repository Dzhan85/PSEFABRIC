PSEFABRIC is a new approach to network automation and management.

It provides a single point of network management with a simple and intuitive interface, and on the other hand, this solution is very flexible and can work with a wide range of network architectures, with different types of equipment and vendors.

This allows you to see the entire network as a whole and manage it as a single device and at the same time this approach preserves all the strengths of your network. 

You may use different vendors, architectures, equipment (including firewalls and load balancers), etc. In general you don't need to change your old network.
PSEFABRIC implementation does not require the purchase of any new equipment or software. 

This implementation of PSEFABRIC is designed to manage networks, accesses, service chains and can be useful for datacenters and offices.

But PSEFABRIC is more than this single implementation. This is an approach, a new concept. And in the framework of this approach, if it is possible to automate something in your network, you can build it into a PSEFABRIC.
