Psefabric is a new approach in automation and network management. 

It provides a single point of network management with a simple and intuitive interface, and on the other hand this solution is very flexible and can work with a wide range of network architectures, with different types of equipment and vendors.

In general, this approach does not require the purchase of new equipment or software.
