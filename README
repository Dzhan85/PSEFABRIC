Psefabric is a new approach in automation and network management. 

It provides a single point of network management with a simple and intuitive interface, and on the other hand this solution is very flexible and can work with a wide range of network architectures, with different types of equipment and vendors.

This implementation of the facility is designed to manage networks, accesses, service chains and can be useful for datacenters and offices.

But psefabric is not a separate implementation. This is the approach. And in the framework of this approach, if it is possible to automate something on the network, you can build it into a psefabric.

In general, this approach does not require the purchase of new equipment or software.
