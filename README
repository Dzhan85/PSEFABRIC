Psefabric is a new approach in automation and network management. 

It is not a sdn or a network fabric. It is also not a usual network management system and something more than common automation.

It provides a single point of network management with a simple and intuitive interface, and on the other hand, this solution is very flexible and can work with a wide range of network architectures, with different types of equipment and vendors.

This gives you the opportunity to see and manage your network as a single whole, a single device, and at the same time to preserve all the strengths of your network (different architectures, vendors and equipment).

This implementation of psefabric is designed to manage networks, accesses, service chains and can be useful for datacenters and offices.

But the factory is more than this single implementation. This is an approach, new concept. And in the framework of this approach, if it is possible to automate something on the network, you can build it into a psefabric.

In general, psefabric implementation does not require any purchase of new equipment or software.
